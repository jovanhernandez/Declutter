# Declutter
A small bash app I made to organize files on users Desktop into folders based on extension.

NOTE: Do not use in live environment before testing. Depending on what OS you have, it will automatically overwrite old files within the folders for extensions with any file on the Desktop with the same name, causing data integrity issues if you are not careful.
